INITIAL SETUP

1.  You'll need to set up your .env files appropriately.
    Copy either the .env.local.example or .env.docker.example to `.env`
    and change variables appropriately in backend/ and frontend/ both.

2. Install frontend/backend packages by executing `npm install` in each subdir
3. From the BASE /Doggr folder, execute the following:
`sudo rm -rf ./minio && mkdir minio && sudo chown 1001 ./minio`
4. Build your containers with `docker-compose up`
5. Seed everything: From /backend, execute `npm run seed`
6. Bring up back/frontend by executing `npm run dev` in each
